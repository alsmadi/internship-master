## Latest Implementations

2. Within our code we are using USAJobs free API in order to pull internships/jobs into our view to select upon. When clicking on the URL for desired posting, you will then be redirected to the jobs application page.

3. We have implemented a backend server, so that the frontend will be fetching the api data from our backend. Within the code our api data is hidden through a .env file along with the user agent. If wanting to run this on your own project you will need to obtain the api key and input that into the code along with your email associated with the api source.
